# Brain-Tumor-Classification

This project utilizes the Brain Tumor image dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). Classification is explored through generalized linear model, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks. Shape analysis is also conducted.
